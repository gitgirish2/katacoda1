The first phase in ML Development is 
DATA

![ML Integration Flow](data.png)

Collecting and transforming data usually takes 70% of the time of your project.  

For the purposes of this scenario, we will generate our data with a python random number generator.  
The numbers that we generate will range from 1000 to 3500 and will contain 160 datapoints.  

Click on the command below to chage directories to the location of the data generation part of the code:
`cd ..`{{execute}}

Click on the link below to open the code.  
The first part of this tutorial generates numbers for us to use as our "data".
In real life, you would source your data from a datasource, but we are taking a shortcut in this demo.  
`hello-data.py`{{open}}

Click on the command below to run the code.  It will generate "data".
`python3 hello-data.py`{{execute}}
