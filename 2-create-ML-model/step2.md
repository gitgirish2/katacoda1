The first phase in ML Development is 
DATA

![ML Integration Flow](data.png)

Collecting and transforming data usually takes 70% of the time of your project.  

For the purposes of this scenario, we will generate our data with a python random number generator.  
The numbers that we generate will range from 1000 to 3500 and will contain 160 datapoints.  

`cd ..`{{execute}}

`hello-data.py`{{open}}

`python3 hello-data.py`{{execute}}
