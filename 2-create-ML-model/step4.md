In this section, we will be adding the following to our code:

* Define the operations for the predicting values using tensorflow method for add and multiply, so it happens in the learning env.

* Define the Loss Function (how much error) - mean squared error

* Optimizer Learning Rate (Size of steps down the gradient) 

* Define the Loss Function (how much error) - mean squared error

* Optimizer Learning Rate (Size of steps down the gradient)

* Define a Gradient optimizer that will minimize the loss defined in the operation "fail_prob"
