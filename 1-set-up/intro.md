Welcome to Scenario 1 (Environment Set-up) of the "Serving a Machine Learning Model in a Private Cloud" Tutorial.

The goal of this trillogy of scenarios is to set up an environment, create an ML model and serve that model.

The goal of this first scenario is to explalin basic environment setup.

This scenario will take us through the steps we need to set up our 
tensorflow and python environment to create a basic ML model.

This scenario uses the container approach to set up the environment, and explains the differences between container set-up and non-container set-up.
