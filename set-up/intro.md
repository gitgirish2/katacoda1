Welcome to Scenario 1 (Environment Set-up) of the "Serving a Machine Learning Model in a Private Cloud" Tutorial.

The goal is to explalin basic environment setup.

This scenario will take us through the steps we need to set up our

This scenario uses the container approach to set up the environment, and explains the differences between container set-up and non-container set-up.
